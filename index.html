  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Ph.D student at the University of Washington working with Professor <a href="https://melaniewalsh.org/">Melanie Walsh</a> on topics in cultural analytics.
	I research contemporary culture with both humanistic and computational methods. I think a lot about the relationships between economics and aesthetic production and consumption. I also think about the multiplicity of genres, structures and mediums that constitute modern storytelling.
	Before starting my Ph.D, I worked as a data scientist in marketing analytics, and I studied English Literature, Mathematics, and Computer Science as part of the Honors Program at Swarthmore College.
	Feel free to reach out over email if you'd like to get in touch.
